# RepVGG: Making VGG-style ConvNets Great Again

This is a super simple ConvNet architecture that achieves over 80% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a stack of 3x3 conv and ReLU! This repo contains the pretrained models, code for building the model, training, and the conversion from training-time model to inference-time.


# Abstract

We present a simple but powerful architecture of convolutional neural network, which has a VGG-like inference-time body composed of nothing but a stack of 3x3 convolution and ReLU, while the training-time model has a multi-branch topology. Such decoupling of the training-time and inference-time architecture is realized by a structural re-parameterization technique so that the model is named RepVGG. On ImageNet, RepVGG reaches over 80\% top-1 accuracy, which is the first time for a plain model, to the best of our knowledge. On NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, RepVGG models run 83% faster than ResNet-50 or 101% faster than ResNet-101 with higher accuracy and show favorable accuracy-speed trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art models like EfficientNet and RegNet.

# ImageNet training settings:

We trained for 120 epochs with cosine learning rate decay from 0.1 to 0. We used 8 GPUs, global batch size of 256, weight decay of 1e-4 (no weight decay on fc.bias, bn.weight and bn.bias), and the same simple data preprocssing as the PyTorch official example:
```
            trans = transforms.Compose([
                transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
                transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
                transforms.ToTensor(),
                transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                                         std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
            ])
```
            

# Use like this:
```
train_model = create_RepVGG_A0(deploy=False)
train train_model ...
deploy_model = repvgg_convert(train_model, create_RepVGG_A0, save_path='repvgg_deploy.pth')
```
